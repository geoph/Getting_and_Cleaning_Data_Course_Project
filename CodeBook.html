<h2>Code Book</h2>

<p>This code book will describe the data used in this project, as well as the processing required to create the resulting tidy data set file.</p>

<h3>Data Set Information</h3>

<p>The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. </p>

<p>The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. </p>

<h3>File Explanation</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>features.txt</code>: Names of the 561 features.</li>
<li><code>activity_labels.txt</code>: Names and IDs for each of the 6 activities.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Into train folder</h4>

<ul>
<li><code>X_train.txt</code>: 7352 observations of the 561 features, for 21 of the 30 volunteers.</li>
<li><code>y_train.txt</code>: A vector of 7352 integers, denoting the ID of the activity related to each of the observations in <code>X_train.txt</code>.</li>
<li><code>subject_train.txt</code>: A vector of 7352 integers, denoting the ID of the volunteer related to each of the observations in <code>X_train.txt</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Into test folder</h4>

<ul>
<li><code>X_test.txt</code>: 2947 observations of the 561 features, for 9 of the 30 volunteers.</li>
<li><code>y_test.txt</code>: A vector of 2947 integers, denoting the ID of the activity related to each of the observations in <code>X_test.txt</code>.</li>
<li><code>subject_test.txt</code>: A vector of 2947 integers, denoting the ID of the volunteer related to each of the observations in <code>X_test.txt</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>More information about the files &amp; features is available in <code>README.txt</code> &amp; <code>features_info.txt</code>. </p>

<h3>Processing steps</h3>

<p>An R script called run_analysis.R was created that does the following. </p>

<ul>
<li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
<li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. </li>
<li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li>
<li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. </li>
<li>Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. </li>
</ul>
